//Basic idea of cgi: running external script
// External script is specified in the config file: the extention and the name
// if HTTP request makes a request with the relative cgi path, the cgi gets executed

// If cgi is specified in a location block, the path specified is handled as cgi input.
// If uri from the http request is the same as a cgi path specified in the config files, cgi script will be exectuted
// SO: if match request & cgi path: execute cgi class
// Should work with GET (coolCgi) and POST(file upload)

// works for port 8081
// works for .php 
// make sure the php has x rights
// Set runLoc to the path of the .php runner (command: which php)

// Execution of cgi: create a child process (with fork), then replace the child process wiht the cgi script (with execve)
// pipes: responsible for sending data to the CGI script and receiving data from it: for file upload
